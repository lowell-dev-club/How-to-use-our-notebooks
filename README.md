# How to use Dev Club notebooks online
This is quick set of instructions on how to import a notebook to google collab to check our code or use it.

First you will want to open [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com)

Next find a GitHub Repo with one of our notebooks, it will say the primary language is Jupyter Notebook. Heres an example:
![Jupyter Notebook Github Repo](https://github.com/lowell-dev-club/How-to-use-our-notebooks/raw/master/example-repo.png)

After that you will need to copy the GitHub Repo url. Then head back to Google Collab. When you open to google collab it should look similar to this, if it doesn't try reloading the page to make the box pop up:
![Google Collab loading page](https://github.com/lowell-dev-club/How-to-use-our-notebooks/raw/master/google-collab-open.png)

Switch to the Github tab and paste in the Github Repo url, after loading for a short bit your google collab should look like this:
![Google Collab loading github repo](https://github.com/lowell-dev-club/How-to-use-our-notebooks/raw/master/google-collab-github.png)

From there click on the .ipynb file that appears and it will open the Notebook for you to read, use, and test with!
